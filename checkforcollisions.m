function collided = checkforcollisions(jointPositions, obstacles)
% Input:    jointPositions - 6 x 3 matrix, where each row represents one 
%               joint along the robot. Each row contains the [x,y,z]
%               coordinates of the respective joint's center (mm). For
%               consistency, the first joint should be located at [0,0,0].
%           obstacles - n x 6 matrix, where each row represents one 
%               rectangular prism obstacle that exists in the physical 
%               environment. 
%			
% Outputs:	True - if the distance between any of the joints and any of the
%               obstacles in the environment is within the collisionRadius 
%           False - if all of the joints are far enough away from the
%               obstacles in the environment (outside the collisionRadius)
%
